I wouldn't normally think of a 28mm lens as particularly [bokehlicious][1]. 

Get a fifty for such purposes.

However, the Q's maximum aperture of ∆í/1.7 leads to some interesting results on its own.

Note the [shutter speed][2].[^1] It's photos like this that make me think twice about an M.[^2]

[^1]: M8 notwithstanding, the maximum shutter speed for all digital M's is 1/4000.
[^2]: I *really* don't want to have to remember to bring ND filters with me all the time.

	That said, I think most people who insist on shooting Leica glass wide open outside (üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è?) just leave their 1-3 stop ND filters mounted all the time. So I'm not really sure what I'm complaining about.
