### My Leica History

Hi, I'm Anthony üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My first Leica was the [Q][1]. I bought it right before a trip to Wyoming in 2017.

I loved that camera.

But like a lot of first-time Leica [Q] owners, after several months, I yearned for an M.

I sold it a few months ago, and started my journey toward M ownership.

Although I was initially set on the M-P (Typ 240)[^1] and the venerable Summilux-M 50mm 1.4 ASPH., I've been considering older M's as of late.

Call me crazy, but there's something so charming about that little \`remaining exposures\` LCD on the top of the M8. And that 1/8000 shutter---‚úåÔ∏è out, ND filters.

...But the M8's crop sensor is a problem.

And it's not the resolution of the resultant images that bothers me. It's that the 1.33x crop factor.

I probably won't be able to afford both a 50mm and a 28mm lens with my first M.

I'll have to choose one.

Of course, it's not called "nifty fifty" for no reason.

Therefore, I'm inclined to go with the Summilux 50, but with the M8's 1.33 crop factor, the effective focal length of the 50mm lux is ~67mm---much too tele for most of my uses.

The 28mm Summicron,[^2] though---that would be a nice match with the M8. Crop factor considered, the 22mm cron would have an effective focal length of 37mm, which isn't that different from 35mm, which isn't that different from 50mm.

Then again, I *could* skip all this and just get an M9-P. No crop factor, the last Kodak CCD, and black paint.

Decisions!

[^1]: Heretofore known as the `MP240`
[^2]: M8/M9/whatever---no matter the camera body, there's no way I'm paying ~$5K for the Summi*lux* 28mm üòÜ
